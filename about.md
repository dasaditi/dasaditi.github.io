I am currently doing my Master's in Data Science from UC Berkeley(MIDS) and researching on various machine learning algorithm.

This blog serves as my personal scratchpad: I mainly post to reinforce the insights I have gained solving a variety of problems but I also hope the content can prove useful to readers working on similar problems.
