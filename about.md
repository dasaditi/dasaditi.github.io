I am a student for life; currently doing my Master's in Data Science from UC Berkeley(MIDS) and researching on various machine learning algorithm.  
I studied Electrical Science at the Jadavpur University,India and then worked at several technology companies. I spent most of my career as a programmer and still learning new things everyday.

This blog serves as my personal scratchpad: I mainly post to reinforce the insights I have gained solving a variety of problems but I also hope the content can prove useful to readers working on similar problems.  

Stay Curious!!!
