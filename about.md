I am an aspiring Data Scientist and student for life with an insatiable love for actionable data analysis, machine learning, and deep networks. I did my Master's in Data Science from UC Berkeley(MIDS) and have worked on projects in several domains like computer vision, edge computing, and natural language processing.

Every data has a story to tell. If you have enough patience to dig deep, you can unearth the mysteries of data and learn from it. I am amazed at how different mathematical algorithms 
can work wonders on data and gain insights from it. My biggest takeaway from the MIDS program is how beautifully you can tell a story - the art behind data science.

This blog serves as my personal scratchpad: I mainly post to reinforce the insights I have gained solving a variety of problems but I also hope the content can prove useful to readers working on similar problems.  

Stay Curious!!!
