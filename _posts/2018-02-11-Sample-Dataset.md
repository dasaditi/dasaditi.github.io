## Introduction

scikit-learn is packaged with some sample toy datasets to address both classification and regression problems. The details of the datasets can be found [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#toy-datasets).There are around 7 datasets at the time of writing. They are very handy if you want to explore various models without worrying too much where to get the data from. We will go over the breast cancer dataset here , the rest of the datasets follow the similar pattern.

The breast cancer dataset is a classic and very easy binary classification dataset. The motivation behind studying this dataset is the develop an algorithm, which would be able to predict whether a patient has a malignant or benign tumor, based on the features computed from her breast mass.

## Lets load the dataset
```python
from sklearn import datasets
cancer = datasets.load_breast_cancer()
type(cancer)
```
```
 sklearn.utils.Bunch
```
load_breast_cancer() returns a dictionary-like object called bunch , with attributes  **_data_** : that holds the observations to learn from and **_target_**: the classification labels.  

You might be wondering why *data* and *target* are separate? scikit-learn expects the features and classification labels to be passed to the machine learning model as separate objects, hence cancer.data and cancer.target are stored separately.   

You may also load the data separately into two objects at the first go instead of the Bunch object by setting *return_X_y=True* .


```python
X,y=datasets.load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)
```

## Learn more about the dataset

Before you begin modeling it is always a good idea to understand the origin, history  and characteristics of the datasets. scikit-learn provides you with DESCR attribute for exactly that purpose. As you see below the description talks about the number of observations, feature list, missing attributes if any etc etc...


```python
print(cancer.DESCR)
```

    **Data Set Characteristics:**
    
        :Number of Instances: 569
    
        :Number of Attributes: 30 numeric, predictive attributes and the class
    
        :Attribute Information:
            - radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
            - texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
            - perimeter
            - area
            - smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
            - compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
            - concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
            - concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
            - symmetry 
            - fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
    
            The mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest (mean of the three
            largest values) of these features were computed for each image,
            resulting in 30 features.  For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field
            13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.

    Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle
    aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.  They describe
    characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
    
    Separating plane described above was obtained using
    Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) [K. P. Bennett, "Decision Tree
    Construction Via Linear Programming." Proceedings of the 4th
    Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Society,
    pp. 97-101, 1992], a classification method which uses linear
    programming to construct a decision tree.  Relevant features
    were selected using an exhaustive search in the space of 1-4
    features and 1-3 separating planes.
    
    The actual linear program used to obtain the separating plane
    in the 3-dimensional space is that described in:
    [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear
    Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets",
    Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].

## Exploring *data* and *target*
As mentioned above, there are two attributes of the dataset. *data* holds the array of observations while *target* stores the classification labels.


```python
print(cancer.data.shape)
print(cancer.target.shape)

```
  (569, 30)
  (569,)


As you see the breast cancer dataset contains 569 observations with 30 features.The data attribute is 2 dimensional : each row represents an observation while each column represents a feature. The target contains 569 classification. Let's look at the feature name of the data set. You can think of these as the column headers of the data.There should be one response corresponding to each observation.


```python
cancer.feature_names
```




    array(['mean radius', 'mean texture', 'mean perimeter', 'mean area',
           'mean smoothness', 'mean compactness', 'mean concavity',
           'mean concave points', 'mean symmetry', 'mean fractal dimension',
           'radius error', 'texture error', 'perimeter error', 'area error',
           'smoothness error', 'compactness error', 'concavity error',
           'concave points error', 'symmetry error',
           'fractal dimension error', 'worst radius', 'worst texture',
           'worst perimeter', 'worst area', 'worst smoothness',
           'worst compactness', 'worst concavity', 'worst concave points',
           'worst symmetry', 'worst fractal dimension'], dtype='<U23')




```python
cancer.target_names
```




    array(['malignant', 'benign'], dtype='<U9')



Let's look closely at the *target* attribute. *target* represents the outcome that we are going to predict. 0 represents malignant tumor while 1 represents benign tumor. However, the data provided to us is in 0/1 in the target object.



```python
print(cancer.target)

```

     1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1]



This is because scikit-learn only expects to see numbers in features and response object , hence *cancer.target* is stored in 0 and 1 instead of 'malignant' and 'benign'. scikit-learn also expects the response should always be numeric regardless of whether it is regression or classification.

Let's look at the datatype of *data* and *target*. scikit-Learn expects the features and labels to be stored as numpy arrays .


```python
type(cancer.data)
type(cancer.target)
```




    numpy.ndarray



As per the scikit-learn convention , the feature data is stored in a variable X (X is capitalized as it represents a matrix) and response data in y( y is lowercase as it represents a vector)


```python
X= cancer.data
y = cancer.target
```

Now you are ready to explore the data and model. 
#### Happy Modeling!!!
